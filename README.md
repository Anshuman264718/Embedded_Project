Heat control system project using Atmega328

# ABOUT THE PROJECT
A heat control system is build using Atmega328. The button sensor first senses if a passanger or driver is onbaorded in the car. when the driver/passanger press the heat button the sensor recognizes it. When both button sensor and heat sensor are turned on the led glows. Only then the tempearture sensor works and takes values from the ADC whose output is shown as pulse width modulation. All the data us transffered using UART communication protocol.
